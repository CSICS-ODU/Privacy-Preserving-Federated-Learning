# Privacy Preserving Federated Learning
- [ ]  Train and save a ML model first
 - Run '**centrailzed.py**' with appropriate arguments to train and save a centralized ML mode     
    
 - Run '**server.py**' and one or more '**client.py**' with appropriate arguments to run federated learning, non-simulated, and save a federally trained ML model.  The server and clients can  be on any    machine.   
   
 - **Deprecated**: Run '**simulate.py**' to simulate federated learning, and save a federally trained ML model.
 
- [ ]  Run '**attack.py**' with appropriate arguments to execute membership inference attack on a saved ML model


To use **secure mode for server-client**, run the '**generate.sh**' or '**generate.bat**' script in the folder '**certificate**' to generate the required self-signed certificates



For information about script arguments run **python \<filename\>.py -h**
