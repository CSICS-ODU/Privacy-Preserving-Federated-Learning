# Privacy Preserving Federated Learning

Run '**centrailzed.py**' to execute a centralized run

~~Run '**simulate.py**' to simulate federated learning~~ 

Run 'server.py' and one or more '**client.py**' to run federated learning, non-simulated.  The server and clients can be on any machine.

To use **secure mode for server-client**, run the '**generate.sh**' or '**generate.bat**' script in the folder '**certificate**' to generate the required self-signed certificates



For instructions: ****python \<filename\>.py -h**
